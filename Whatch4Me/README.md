Bascially this is the watchface I wanted - designed for me perhaps useful for you.
Feedback / comments via twitter : @whatchforme

I wrote and tested this on Venu during April 2020 when I was looking to learn some skills and find something to do with my time.  Stay Safe.

Back in the day (with an original vivoactive) I loved SimpleActive-
https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/fa683ad9-0c18-4c12-85af-6dea062ed308
I appreciated being able to see my step history over the last 7 days and the encouragement to keep the whole week Green.

This watchface is inspired by that along with multiple other watchfaces that all did some of what I wanted but not everything.  

Key features: 
------------------
	Sunrise/Sunset - the next sun events - SET LOCATION IN Connect IQ Settings.
	Days To/Since date - count down to an event (birthday, run, christmas) or count up from an aniversary or a bad habit you are trying to break. Set the date in Settings via Connect IQ.  Can also be dissabled in 
	Steps Streak - intially calculated based on the days that the watchface sees (last 7 days). The code saves the date it last sees a missed day - and then counts from then.  If you miss a day this will reset.  Can be overridden by Connect IQ settings but that will only work if there are no missed days in the settings. 


Screen Description :
---------------------
	Battery %
	Sunrise,  Heart Rate, Sunrise
	Date,  Bluetooth connect (blue filled circle)
	Time
	Step Average (for 8 days including today)*
	Max Steps (for 7 days not including today because 
	Days To/Since date - (See explanation above) - optional CIQ setting.
	Step Graph history (Grey for unmet, green for met, blue for today)
	Steps today / Streak Days (See explanation above)

	Low Power Mode -  Just the time - in small font - moving every minute to meet the Venu Low Power Rules -  only active if Timeout="Always On"  is on - recomended with Gesture Sensitivity = "High"

Connect IQ Settings:
-----------------------------

	Lattitude -  Location for Sunrise/set:   +- 90
	Longitude - Location for Sunrise/set:   +-180
	(Use Google Maps "whats here" to get Latitude,Longitude Pair as decimal degrees)
	Display Day (to/Since) or not - optionally turn on/off the to/since date
	To/Since Date - select a day to count down to or up from.
	Attempt to Override Streak (y/n)  one time setting - to override useing the following date
	Override Streak Date - the date to be used to override the start of streak
	(read above re Streak Date - a missed day in your 7 day history will mean this override date wont work)

Known Issues / Small Print: 
--------------------------------
	Tested on Venu 
	Simulator tested on other watch face sizes

	Streak:
	Streak will only be accurate if Whatch4Me is run every day (or at least once a week) - which it would be if this was your daily watchface
	If you used this Whatch4Me once - then chose another for daily use - and missed a bunch of days - but then came back to Whatch4Me during a week that you had made steps goal everyday - then Whatch4Me would not have "seen" your misssed days and would incorrectly give you a very long streak dating back to when you last used the Whatch4Me. You can use the override setting to correct this situation.
